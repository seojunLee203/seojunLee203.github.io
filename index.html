                <h2>What Is Cybersecurity?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These
                    cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money
                    from users via ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more
                    devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.
                </p>

                <h2>Why is Cybersecurity Important?</h2>
                <p>
                    In today’s connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cyberdefense programs. At an individual level, a
                    cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft, to extortion attempts, to the loss of
                    important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals,
                    and financial service companies. Securing these and other organisations is essential to keeping our society
                    functioning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone also benefits from the work of cyberthreat researchers, like the team of 250 threat researchers at
                    Talos, who investigate new and emerging threats and cyber attack strategies. They reveal new vulnerabilities,
                    educate the public on the importance of cybersecurity, and strengthen open source tools. Their work makes the
                    Internet safer for everyone.

                <h2>Types of Cybersecurity Threats</h2>
                <h3>Phishing</h3>
                <p>
                    Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails that resemble emails from reputable sources. The aim
                    is to steal sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information. It’s the most common type of cyber
                    attack. You can help protect yourself through education or a technology solution that filters malicious
                    emails.
                </p>
                <h3>Social Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    Social engineering is a tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive information. They
                    can solicit a monetary payment or gain access to your confidential data.
                </p>
                <h3>Ransomware</h3>
                <p>
                    Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to extort money by blocking access to files or the
                    computer system until the ransom is paid. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that the files will be
                    recovered or the system restored.
                </p>
                <h3>Malware</h3>
                <p>
                    Malware is a type of software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer.
